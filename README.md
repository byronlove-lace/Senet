# Senet

The ancient egyptian boardgame Senet.

## Description

This program uses ncurses to create the UI of the board. It uses the C++ random library to simulate the dice sticks and evaluate their scores.

## Progress

Currently developing pieces and game logic.

## Background

I started this program to better understand ncurses.

## Credit

The basis of this program comes from Jim Hall at Linux Journal: https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/programming-text-windows-ncurses
He provided an guide for the ncurses UI. The additional functionallity is my own.
